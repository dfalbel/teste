summary: "To get started with this theme, first make sure you have all the prerequisites in place; then build the theme following the sample build commands. Because this theme is set up for single sourcing projects, it doesn't follow the same pattern as most Jekyll projects (which have just a _config.yml file in the root directory)."

```{r opts, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "images/"
)
```




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
